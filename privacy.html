    <h2>When does Security Firearm Auctions use customer information from third parties?</h2>
    <p>We do not ingest data from social media platforms on the demo. If we enable contact forms or anti-spam services (e.g., reCAPTCHA) in the future, we will update this policy to describe those services and the data they process.</p>
  
    <h2>Do we share the information we collect with third parties?</h2>
    <p>We may disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.</p>
  
    <h2>Where and when is information collected from customers and end users?</h2>
    <p>Security Firearm Auctions will collect personal information that you submit to us. We may also receive personal information about you from third parties as described above.</p>
  
    <h2>How Do We Use The Information We Collect?</h2>
    <p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)</li>
      <li>To improve our website (we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)</li>
      <li>To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h2>
    <p>We do not send marketing emails from the demo. If you contact us, we may reply to your message to address your inquiry.</p>
  
    <h2>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
    <p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Security Firearm Auctions to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p>
  
    <h2>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>
    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Security Firearm Auctions or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
  
    <h2>Can I update or correct my information?</h2>
    <p>The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information Security Firearm Auctions collects depend on your relationship with Security Firearm Auctions. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.</p>
    <p>Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes, and deletions will not affect other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change, or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>
    <p>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media, will be updated, corrected, changed, or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p>
    <p>If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</p>
  
    <h2>Personnel</h2>
    <p>If you are a Security Firearm Auctions worker or applicant, we collect information you voluntarily provide to us. We use the information collected for Human Resources purposes to administer benefits to workers and screen applicants.</p>
    <p>You may contact us to (1) update or correct your information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) receive a record of the information we have relating to you. Such updates, corrections, changes, and deletions will not affect other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy before such update, correction, change, or deletion.</p>
  
    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the State of Wisconsin, without regard to conflicts of law.</p>
  
    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using this demo, you acknowledge this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the demo.</p>
  
    <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Security Firearm Auctions. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored, or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our platform, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own cookies or other methods to collect information about you.</p>
  
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p><strong>>Cookies:</strong> The demo uses only essential cookies required for basic functionality. We do not use analytics or advertising cookies on the demo.</p>
  
    <h2>Blocking and disabling cookies and similar technologies</h2>
    <p>Wherever you're located, you may also set your browser to block cookies and similar technologies. Still, this action may block our essential cookies and prevent our website from functioning properly, and you may not be able to fully utilize all of its features and services. You should also be aware that you may also lose some saved information (e.g., saved login details, site preferences) if you block cookies on your browser. Different browsers make different controls available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your browser; you will need to do this yourself from within your browser; you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p>
  
    <h2>Payment Details</h2>
    <p>This demo does not accept online payments. No payment card data is collected or stored.</p>

    <h2>Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to this Privacy Policy so that
     they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for
     example, through our Service) before we make changes to this Privacy Policy and allow you to
     review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the
     page 7/11
     updated Privacy Policy. If you do not want to agree to this or any updated Privacy Policy, you can delete
     your account.
